# Penguin-Explorer-Swift
That's a fun Swift project where you catch virtual penguins and add them to your own collection. It’s been a cool experience working with Mac, and the project is still a work in progress with exciting updates ahead. Explore different habitats and build your penguin library—it’s all about having a great time while discovering new things!
